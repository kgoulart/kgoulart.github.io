# Introduction to R - Toni Rodon

# S language allows you to create packages and functions.
# CRAN package respository
# 2 conceptual parts - 1. 'base' R system that you download from CRAN; 2. everything else; download a library.
# Quantitative Social Science - An Introduction
# Stack overflow - reddit for softwares

# Things you can do - 
# can automate weekly reports (like macros in excel)
# can use it for websites
# can extract info from instagram and facebook - and telegram/whatsapp
# can do 3-D graphics
# can extract text from a pdf (or an old pdf) which is an image.

# R is an object-based language - everything has a name; everything is a object; and every object has a class.
# Variable names cannot have blank spaces; case-sensitive
# An object can only be of 1 class (not hybrid numbers) - observations have to be consistent.
# it is possible to work with multiple objects at the same time
# you can call objects from different datasets

###########
# OBJECTS #
###########
# character string - words
# numbers
# vectors - list of different characters
# matrices - collection of vectors
# data frame - dataset
# list - collection of different things
# NA - missing variables = dot in stata
# undefined - (is.null) - nothing there
# TRUE: logical TRUE(isTRUE) - logical values - logical vector / FALSE 
#   type of variable that are logical
# Tip - create dataframes whenever you can
# have to install the package everytime R is updated.

# install packages
# Github - dropbox for geeks
# CRAN - official packages by R
# Twitter - to find new packages - #rstats; #tidytuesday
# rbloggers - newsletter
