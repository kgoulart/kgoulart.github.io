## Research Questions

1. Is there a link between an unemployment spell and future job quality?

2. Does an unemployment spell leave a scar on future job quality?

---
## Scarring Literature
- Primary focus in the past has been on monetary rewards, i.e. wages

- Two Key Mechanisms:

  - Human capital depreciation (Becker, 1964)

  - Signaling (Spence, 1973)

---
## Previous Scarring Literature on Non-monetary Rewards
- Brand (2006) followed displaced workers in WI, USA.

  - Blue-collar workers saw a decrease in their employer-sponsored benefits.

  - White-collar workers saw a decrease in their job content, i.e. autonomy and authority.

- Diekoff (2011) conducted a cross-national comparative analysis of four countries.

  - Found key country differences due to institutional factors.

  - Used a select set of job quality measures.

---
## Job Quality Definition
- There is no consensus on what is considered a “good” or “bad” job.

- Autonomy and control over one’s tasks is almost universally included in job quality definitions.

- Braverman (1975) and other Marxist sociologists argued that there was a trend of “deskilling the worker.”

- The dimensions of job security has gained traction due to neoliberal policies to increase flexibility in the labor markets.

- The biggest disagreement is over the use of job satisfaction.

---
## Hypotheses
- H1: Unemployment penalty - An unemployment spells leads to reductions in job quality.

- H2: Scarring effect - An unemployment spell results in a scar that reduces job quality and can linger beyond a year after re-employment.

- H3: Key gender differences - It is possible that women experience harsher unemployment penalties and scarring effects than men.

---
## Data and Methodology
- Sample:

  - UK Understanding Society Survey (2009 - 2019)

  - Limited to working age adults (25-55) at the start of their entrance into the survey

  - Self-employed individuals were dropped.

  - Each individual had to report at least one job quality score before and after the unemployment spell.

- Limitations:

  - Working conditions module was conducted every even-numbered wave, therefore a three-wave average was computed for the job quality scores to smooth the data.

---
## Data and Methodology (cont.)
- The dependent variables of job quality are created using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which seeks to reduce the dimensionality of a larger set of variables.

- The job quality dimensions used in the analysis follow Green and Mostafa's definiton of job quality, which includes autonomy, authority, work intensity, work-life balance, and job security.

- The main independent variables of interest are:
  - Unemployment penalty - If the person has any unemployment spell in their history (binary)
  
  - Scarring penalty - time since re-entry into the formal workforce (categorical)

---
## Data and Methodology (cont.)
- The analysis consists of separate random effects within and between (REWB) regression models that estimate the extent to which unemployment spells lead to reductions in job quality.

-  To be clear, the within effect (i.e. fixed effects) estimations are prioritized in this analysis, as the  main focus is to determine how unemployment spells affect changes in job quality within individuals.

- However Bell &amp; colleagues advocate for the usage of REWB models, which can provide additional context when looking at between groups. 

- Furthermore the inclusion of interaction effects require mixed effects models, as some time-invariant variables of interest (e.g. gender) would not be included in the fixed effects only models.

---
## Institutional Context

- The UK labour market is marked by increased flexibility, with relatively little employment protection.

- In contrast to its European neighbours, the UK labour market did not experience unprecedented high unemployment rates during the Great Recession.

## PCA Results

- PCA on 9 variables was conducted to create a job quality index.

  - PC1 - Represents overall job quality
  
  - PC2 - Represents job security

## Hypothesis 1: Unemployment Penalty

## Hypothesis 2: Scarring Effect
&lt;img src="PhD_workshop_2021_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Interaction: Scarring Effect by Gender
&lt;img src="PhD_workshop_2021_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Conclusion
- The European policy priority continues to be full employment, but this analysis suggests that unemployment can lead to scars on future job outcomes and possibly longer term career trajectories.

- The scarring literature speaks little about the intragenerational effect that unemployment spells have on future life outcomes and career trajectories, outside of wages.

- Future research should consider:

  - If spells of non-employment also result in similar scars.

  - If the signaling mechanism also plays a role in scars of job quality.

  - How can individuals best combat negative signals that arise from spells of unemployment.
